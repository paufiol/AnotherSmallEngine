# AnotherSmallEngine
AnotherSmallEngine is pretty self-explanatory, it is a basic 3D Engine developed by 2 students of the [CITM](<https://www.citm.upc.edu/>).
This project is been created as part of CITM's Game Engine course under supervision of professor Marc Garrig√≥.

## How to Use
* **Mouse Wheel:** Zooms camera forward and backwards.
* **Alt + Right click:** Rotate camera over mouse position or else selected game object.
* **Alt + Center click(wheel):** Pan camera.
* **Left click:** Select object / Use Gizmo.
* **W:** Set Guizmo to Translate mode
* **E:** Set Guizmo to Rotate mode
* **R:** Set Guizmo to Scale mode
* Guizmo modes can also be set via the Tool submenu in the main bar

## Libraries used
* STL (Standard Template Library)
* Dear ImGui
    * ImGuizmo
* OpenGL 
* Glew 
* MatGeoLib
* Assimp
* Parson
* DevIL

## Innovations
* **Style Window:** *(top right)* The bottom part of it is just summoned by ImGui, but the top section is custom. It allows for picking of a hue via slider plus three main colors in which you can change the Value/Saturation. This is a significantly quicker, and more visually cohesive way to change the theme for ImGui. The ultimate goal would be to serialise it.
