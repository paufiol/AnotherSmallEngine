# AnotherSmallEngine
AnotherSmallEngine is pretty self-explanatory, it is a basic 3D Engine developed by 2 students of the [CITM](<https://www.citm.upc.edu/>).
This project is been created as part of CITM's Game Engine course under supervision of professor Marc Garrig√≥.

## Innovations
* **Style Window:** *(top right)* The bottom part of it is just summoned by ImGui, but the top section is custom. It allows for picking of a hue via slider plus three main colors in which you can change the Value/Saturation. This is a significantly quicker, and more visually cohesive way to change the theme for ImGui.
