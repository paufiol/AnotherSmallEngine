# AnotherSmallEngine
Another Small Engine (or ASE for short) is a simple, lightweight Game Engine created for academic purposes. Authors are [Pau Fiol](https://github.com/paufiol) and [Aitor Luque](https://github.com/Aitorlb7), working under the supervision of [Marc Garrig√≥](https://github.com/markitus18) for the 3D Engines subject coursed in [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/).

**Warning:** The models won't load if Library folder is erased and the meta files are not, We load with the data stored inside the meta which points to the Custom Files stored in Library. --> To fix that erase all ".meta" files inside Assets folder.

## How to Use
* **Mouse Wheel:** Zooms camera forward and backwards.
* **Alt + Right click:** Rotate camera over mouse position or else selected game object.
* **Alt + Center click(wheel):** Pan camera.
* **Left click:** Select object/Use Gizmo.
* **DELETE:** delete selected Game Object.
* **W:** Set Guizmo to Translate mode.
* **E:** Set Guizmo to Rotate mode.
* **R:** Set Guizmo to Scale mode.
* Within Editor:
  * **Ctrl+C:** Copy.
  * **Ctrl+X:** Cut.
  * **Ctrl+V:** Paste.
  * **Ctrl+Z:** Undo.
  * **Arrow Keys:** Navigation.
* Importing options:
  * Right Click on an item in the explorer -> Import Asset
  * Hold Left Click on an item in the explorer and drag into the scene.
* Saving and Loading an Scene
  * File -> Save Scene -> Write the Name of scene -> Press Enter
  * File -> Load Scene -> Open the expandable select the scene -> Press Load

### High-level System Features
* Shader Pipeline: Load and render 3D models using shaders, and apply textures and materials to them.
  * Use Skybox.
  * Shader Uniforms can be edited and saved from within the inspector.
  * Model, View, Projection Matrices; Time; Camera Position; are all automatically provided to all shaders. 
  * Assign any shader / texture to any given Game Object.
* Text Editor: Click on Edit Shader on the inspector to open a Text Editor. It has color higlighting, basic navigation and text edition commands (Ctrl+C,Ctrl+X,Ctrl+V,Ctrl+Z...). Saving will also recompile the shader to be able to see real-time the changes. Any compilation errors will be shown in the console.
* Water Shader: Vertex shader uses 3 overlapping [Gerstner Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trochoidal_wave) to achieve the desired shape, and the Fragment Shader uses Height and a Texture (in the showcase scene uses [Worley Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise)) To combine colors as well as a bit of reflection.
* Reflection & Reflaction Shader: These are very straightforward shaders once a Skybox is properly setup, and adding them to other shaders is now quite fast
