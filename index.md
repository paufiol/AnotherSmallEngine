# Another Small Engine

Another Small Engine (or ASE for short) is a simple, lightweight Game Engine created for academic purposes. Authors are [Pau Fiol](https://github.com/paufiol) and [Aitor Luque](https://github.com/Aitorlb7), working under the supervision of [Marc Garrig√≥](https://github.com/markitus18) for the 3D Engines subject coursed in [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/).

Our main focus has been in implementing and showcasing a shader pipeline.

### Features

- Shader Pipeline: Geometry drawn via shaders, using Textures and/or materials.
- In-Engine Text Editor and Shader Compilation: Open .shader files (which contain both fragment and vertex shaders) to edit them, and save them to automatically recompile them. If compilation fails, the console will display the compilation error. 
- Shader Uniform edition: Uniform values show up in the inspector and can be edited while running. 
- Mouse Picking & Gizmos: Click to select GameObjects and transform them with Gizmos. 
- Custom File Format: Smaller files containing only the relevant data for our engine. Lighter files, faster execution.
- Resource Management: Assets enter and leave memory as necessary.
- Cameras: Camera culling with a modifiable render distances and FoV. Preview the inGameCamera
